        <div class="introduction"><p>Andrew Katz traces the origins of the problems of copyright legislation and practice when confronted with the natural, human, social mode of creative endeavour. Building on developments in open source software, he outlines how designers could benefit from a similar model and reveals the differences between the digital and the analogue realm.</p>

        <div class="about-author"><p>Andrew Katz is a former software engineer and partner at Moorcrofts LLP in Marlow, Bucks, UK, specializing in advising clients on intellectual property and other aspects of open source software. For Andrew, “a design is an open design if it bears four freedoms. One: The freedom to use the design, including making items based on it, for any purpose. Two: The freedom to study how the design works, and change it to make it do what you wish. Three: The freedom to redistribute copies of the design so you can help your neighbour. Four: The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions of the design to others so the whole community can benefit from your changes. Access to the design documents is a precondition for these freedoms.”<br><br><a href="http://www.moorcrofts.com/">http://www.moorcrofts.com</a></p></div>

            <p>We are reaching the end of a great historical experiment. Printing (starting with Gutenberg-style presses  <a href="http://opendesignnow.org/index.php/tag/printing/">PRINTING</a> and leading to huge industrial Heidelberg printing machines), radio broadcasting, 78s, vinyl, CDs, cinema, television: all these discoveries formed the technological backdrop for this experiment. All are (or were) media based on the principle of one-to-many distribution. To understand how this experiment was initiated, and how it is reaching its end, we need to understand a little of the nature of the businesses involved in these activities, and how the law enabled them to attain, and retain, that nature.  <a href="http://opendesignnow.org/index.php/tag/wys-%E2%89%A0-wyg/">WYS ≠ WYG</a></p>
            <blockquote><p>As the public grew accustomed to the idea of passive consumption, creativity became increasingly marginalized.</p></blockquote>
            <p>The one-to-many broadcast distribution model distorted our perception of creativity. A key characteristic of one-to-many distribution is the role of the gatekeeper: the corporation which decides what we, the public, get to read, watch or listen to. The roles of creator and consumer are starkly defined and contrasted. As the public grew accustomed to the idea of passive consumption, creativity became increasingly marginalized, at least in those areas covered by copyright.  <a href="http://opendesignnow.org/index.php/tag/activism/">ACTIVISM</a> Creativity was perceived as capable of flourishing only through the patronage of the movie studios, the record companies or the TV stations.</p>
            <p>The industrial technology behind printing, broadcasting and vinyl duplication is expensive. Copyright law grants a monopoly which enables the distributors of media to invest in the capital infrastructure required for their packaging and distribution. These are the businesses which grew fat on the monopolies so granted, and they succeeded in convincing the public that it was the corporations’ role to provide, and the public’s role to pay and consume.</p>
            <p>The original social approach to creativity did not become extinct as the dominant producer/consumer mode became established, even for media (like music, for example) where it applied. Andrew Douglas’s film <em>Searching for the Wrong-Eyed Jesus </em>shows that a visitor to the late 20th century Appalachians of the American South may well be asked: “What instrument do you play?” If the visitor answers: “I don’t play any”, the questioner will go on to say: “Ok, so you must sing.”</p>
